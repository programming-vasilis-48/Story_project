SPEECH EVENTS
============

[2025-06-04 17:33:52] ROBOT (fear): You sit in the chair, waiting for the next instruction. The room is quiet, except for the sound of the clock ticking on the wall. The researcher is not in sight, but you hear footsteps coming from the hallway. The door is still open, and you can see the dark corridor outside, leading to the empty labs on Zernike campus.

[2025-06-04 17:34:04] USER: I'm watching through the corridor, but nothing appears to be there, only a door.

[2025-06-04 17:34:19] ROBOT (surprise): You turn back to the room, and the chair is now occupied by someone else. The researcher is sitting in front of you, with a pen stuck in their forehead.

[2025-06-04 17:34:50] USER: Oh no, I called the hospital 9-11 but nobody's answering me. I tried to revive the professor but he's dead, he's completely dead. So then I'll have to get rid of the evidence that is there.

[2025-06-04 17:35:08] ROBOT (disgust): You're trying to clean the pen stain from the professor's forehead, but it's spreading, seeping into the wound. There's a chunk of flesh missing, and you can see the bone underneath, oozing with a clear fluid.

[2025-06-04 17:35:25] USER: Damn, I'm also oozing when I was drinking oranges this evening.

[2025-06-04 17:35:43] ROBOT (sad): You're standing alone in the lab, surrounded by the silence of abandoned equipment and the faint smell of disinfectant. The oranges you were eating are still on the table, their peel wrinkled and brown.

[2025-06-04 17:36:00] USER: Okay, I go to the grocery store and buy some new fresh oranges, like my mom always used to tell me.

[2025-06-04 17:36:15] ROBOT (neutral): You pay for the oranges and leave the store, carrying a bag with a few other items. The cashier scans the next customer's groceries, a woman who is checking her phone.

[2025-06-04 17:36:28] USER: Okay, whatever, I go forward with my day.

[2025-06-04 17:36:45] ROBOT (happy): You walk outside, feeling the warm sun on your skin, and the sound of birds chirping in the trees. You take a deep breath, smelling the sweet aroma of blooming flowers in the park nearby.

[2025-06-04 17:37:01] USER: The flowers are blooming, and the skies are blue. Blue as the tree, I have some glue.

[2025-06-04 17:37:18] ROBOT (angry): You're smashing the glue bottle on the ground, watching as it shatters into a hundred tiny pieces. The blue tree is now covered in sticky, gooey glue, and people are starting to stare.

[2025-06-04 17:37:36] USER: I stare back at them. I'm not afraid. I will stare at them, and they stare back at me, but nothing is happening. We just stare at each other.

[2025-06-04 17:38:09] ROBOT (sad): You sit in a chair on the Zernike campus in Groningen. You're here to take part in a study, just like many others. The room is empty except for the researcher and you. Your phone is still on silent from last night's call that didn't come.

[2025-06-04 17:38:33] USER: My wife of 4 years is on a trip and she is not calling me. I think she is cheating on me on her ski resort. Now let's imagine how she would live there. What happens in the ski resort?

[2025-06-04 17:38:47] ROBOT (surprise): You look out the window and see your wife on the phone with a man who is not her ski instructor. She's laughing and they're both wearing matching ski jackets.

[2025-06-04 17:39:23] USER: Matching ski jackets, I go and rip off the matching ski jacket. Who is that man, I ask. And she says to me, it's my brother, it's my brother, but I don't believe her. Because I know my wife of three years and she doesn't have a brother. And that's actually her ski instructor that also has time with her in bed.

[2025-06-04 17:39:35] ROBOT (neutral): You stand there, facing your wife, and she looks back at you. She says, "Let's go talk about this in the lodge."

[2025-06-04 17:39:49] USER: So we go to the lodge and I'm waiting for my wife to start explaining herself.

[2025-06-04 17:40:04] ROBOT (happy): You walk into the cozy lodge, the aroma of hot chocolate and freshly baked cookies fills the air. You notice the smiling faces of other skiers gathered around the fireplace.

[2025-06-04 17:40:22] USER: It would be a really fun time, but right now my wife is sitting on me and I just understood that, so I can't be happy.

[2025-06-04 17:40:34] ROBOT (angry): You slam your fist on the table, making the hot chocolate cups shake. Your wife's eyes widen as she realizes she's been caught.

[2025-06-04 17:40:55] USER: What are you gonna do about this? I tell her. And then I leave. I tell her, don't come back again. I am taking the children.

[2025-06-04 17:41:13] ROBOT (disgust): You storm out of the lodge, leaving your wife to sit alone, surrounded by the sweet aroma of decay from the trash cans outside. You can't shake the thought of her touching the ski instructor's dirty gloves.

[2025-06-04 17:41:42] USER: But I understand that that is what she is, she's just a dirty ski resort, ski instructor lover that doesn't love me for who I am. And three years with this wife and we reached at this point, this is impossible. How can we do this?

[2025-06-04 17:42:02] ROBOT (fear): You hear the sound of footsteps behind you, heavy and deliberate, getting closer with each passing second. The trees seem to loom over you, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching out to snatch you back.

[2025-06-04 17:42:34] USER: Once the trees are coming for me, I'm so afraid, I don't know what to do, I'm running through the forest, but I'm getting lost. The more I run, the more I get lost, and then I'm inside a witch's hut, I meant.
