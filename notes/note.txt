==================================================
Welcome to the Story-Switch Game!
==================================================
In this game, we'll create a story together. I'll try to make you feel different emotions through storytelling.
You'll type your part of the story, and I'll respond with mine.
The game will end when we've explored each emotion twice.

Story Start:
You sit in the chair, the fluorescent lights above flickering slightly as you wait for instructions. The researcher's voice is calm, but the sound of the door creaking shut behind you makes you think you're alone. You glance around the room, noticing the one-way mirror on the wall, its glass surface reflecting the dim glow of the corridor outside. The chair's legs scrape against the floor as you shift, the sound echoing through the silent space of the Zernike campus.

The researcher's words are muffled, but you can sense the distance in his tone as he says, "You'll be here for a while." Your eyes wander to the small, forgotten plant on the windowsill, its wilted leaves a testament to the neglect that fills the room.

The sunlight streams through the window, warming your skin as the researcher's chair creaks, signaling he's standing up to get you a glass of water. The sound of ice clinking in a glass is music to your ears.

The glass of water sits untouched on the edge of the table, its condensation forming a small puddle that slowly spreads across the surface. The researcher's chair remains empty, the silence a heavy weight that presses down on you.

The researcher's voice is now a low hum, a vibration that seems to come from the very walls themselves. Your name is being called, but it's not the voice you were expecting, it's a voice that sounds exactly like your own.

The words on the notepad start to rearrange themselves, the pencil marks erasing and reforming into a message that wasn't there before. Your reflection in the one-way mirror is replaced by a stranger's face, their eyes staring back at you with a familiarity that's unnerving.

The researcher's breath is a putrid mixture of rot and decay, making your nostrils flare in response. His teeth are yellow and crooked, with visible gaps where teeth have fallen out, leaving behind a trail of festering sores.
